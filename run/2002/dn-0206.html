&nbsp;&nbsp; Ricki McGee, John Taussig, Andre Untiedt, Dick Orciuch, Mark
Hamilton and Carla Moxon participated in this cool beach-side race.&nbsp;
Carla, recently back from Clearwater, hadn't been training and wanted to
do the 5K but missed the start. &nbsp;So she did the 10K and had to settle
for 4th! &nbsp;Well done guys!<br>
                          <b><big><big>Age Division Winners!</big></big></b><br>
&nbsp; Andre Untiedt - 3rd, Carla Moxon - 4th                     <br>
      <big><big><b>Next Races</b></big></big><br>
&nbsp; Note that there has been a change to the race schedule. &nbsp;Also,
note that there are two races October 13th - Long Beach Marathon and Dolphin
Run 10K.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking for more people to participate in the running
team.&nbsp; Don't have to be fast.&nbsp; Don't have to be slim and trim.&nbsp;
Must have willingness to put on a T-shirt and show up at races.&nbsp; Do
you know someone who runs or used to run or wants to run or could be coerced
into running?&nbsp; We'll mentor them!&nbsp; Please call Tara Lee Gerson
(213) 407-4499, <a href="mailto:taragerson@earthlink.net">taragerson@earthlink.net</a>,
or Andre Untiedt (323) 666-5856, <a href="mailto:ausys@earthlink.net">ausys@earthlink.net</a>
with their names.<br>

      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Rumor has it that Maggie arranged for another batch
of uniforms.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we need to build a team of many runners so
we know their sizes. Those who have uniforms - wear them; those who have
any T-shirt that says DIANETICS - wear them; those who don't - wear whatever
you have and a smile.</td>
