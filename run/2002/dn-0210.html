Dolphin Run 5K/10K</b></big></big>&nbsp;      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfect weather and dolphins romping in the ocean confirmed this
race as a favorite. Carla Moxon, Lisa Miller, Peter Specker, Bruce Goodman,
Bruce Gaines, Jane Rietman, Maggie Butterworth, Jamie Butterworth,  Dick
Orciuch, Mark Hamilton, Diane Christian, Skeeter Thomas, Burt Joseph, Alex
Nunn, Pam Taylor, Bruce and Andre Untiedt made up the biggest team we've
fielded this year. We did the traditional gathering at the finish to cheer
team members in, with Lisa eliciting the biggest roar for some reason. Maggie
looked fabulous, as always. Dicko took the Mr. Cool award in his shades.
Our bright uniforms were visible for miles&#8212;created quite an impact! There
were plenty of goodies for the runners at the end and Carla and others disseminated
to public. &nbsp;Thank you to Bruce Nunn for taking photos.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Division Winners:</span> &nbsp;Alex
Nunn took 2nd place and Andre Untiedt took 3rd! &nbsp;And Alex and Skeeter
also ran sub-40 minutes with Burt hot on their heels. <br>
